# MulticopterDynamics
A model to simulate multicopter tilt dynamics around each axis
Setting PID gains for a DIY multicopter is tedious and most often the optinal combination is not found.
We propose here a dynamical model for a multicopter to help testing different control strategies.
The model supposes that the UAV can only rotate about its three axis. The engine and propeller inertia,
as well as the propeller aerodynamics are taken into account.
